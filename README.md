# mta_scripts
A collection of some of the resources/scripts I made for Multi Theft Auto San Andreas ( multiplayer gamemode for GTASA)

All the resources were written by Mann (v0lta1c) and run for the game Multi Theft Auto : San Andreas only. They were developed either for Gamenet.ga servers or for personal use.
The resources were written in LUA with complementary meta-files and database or .map files where required.

NOTE : All the resources mentioned here were developed on MTASA ver 1.5.0. The currently release version might have some better functions/methods for performing the same tasks but all the resources stay backward compatible!

A lot of the resources were made to support and complement the DayZ gamemode. A fork to the same exists on my profile!
